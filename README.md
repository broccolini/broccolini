### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ 

I'm @broccolini, Head of Design at GitHub. 

Iâ€™m a designer with an interest in [systems thinking](https://www.chelseagreen.com/product/thinking-in-systems/), [code as a material](https://www.clarityconf.com/session/code-is-a-material), and [inclusive design](https://www.microsoft.com/design/inclusive/). I like to give back to the design community by [speaking](http://broccolini.net/#talks) at conferences, occasionally [writing](http://broccolini.net/#writing) articles and [books](https://www.designbetter.co/design-systems-handbook), and when itâ€™s safe to hang out in person, organizing the NYC chapter of the [Design Systems Coalition](https://designsystems.nyc/).

**At GitHub:** Over the past ~6 years I led the Design Infrastructure team which developed GitHubâ€™s design system, [Primer](https://primer.style/), from [CSS](https://primer.style/css/) framework to [React](https://primer.style/react/) and [Rails](https://primer.style/view-components/) component libraries; and reshaped GitHubâ€™s UX through [redesigning the repository homepage](https://github.blog/changelog/2020-06-23-design-updates-to-repositories-and-github-ui/), incrementally [responsified desktop layouts](https://github.blog/changelog/2019-11-01-improved-issue-editing-and-comment-features-on-mobile-web/), [refreshed the visual design](https://github.blog/changelog/2020-06-23-design-updates-to-repositories-and-github-ui/), introduced new ways to interact with GitHub through the [command palette](https://github.blog/changelog/2021-10-27-command-palette-beta/) (in beta), and delivered one of GitHubâ€™s most highly requested featuresâ€”[dark mode](https://github.blog/changelog/2020-12-08-dark-mode-public-beta/).

**About me:** I grew up in the UK and started my career in print design. In my early 20's I went back-packing to Australia and ended up living there for ~8 years, and became a citizen. I worked in government and then for a small agency that specialized in environmental and social change projects. I ended up moving to the U.S. in 2011 by way of a startup bus hackathon competition. After a few years working in tech in San Francisco I moved to NYC to work for Etsy, where I was part of a small team that built a new design system. I still live in New York where I work remotely for GitHub, with my husband and 2 catsâ€”Leia and Chewie.

**Current interests:** Iâ€™m learning about [what makes great leaders](https://fs.blog/knowledge-podcast/), [reading sci-fi books](http://broccolini.net/reading/), ~~learning about~~ collecting [low profile mechanical keyboards](https://twitter.com/broccolini/status/1452040989330259975?s=20), and forever interested in [color](https://www.aiga.org/inspiration/talks/diana-mounter-color-from-chaos).
